Here’s a quick guide to the contribution process:

1. (The most important step!) **Create a thread** in #ask-design-system about your change.
   **Get approval** from @markabarrett and/or @moshebaricdo (design team).
   For technical details, ask @levadadenys.
2. Create a separate PR with `@code-dot-org/component-library` code changes.

3. Get it approved by @moshebaricdo and/or @markabarrett (design) and @levadadenys (technical implementation).

4. Merge the PR once approved.

5. Use it in your code → Celebrate → Collect tons of appreciation! 🎉
