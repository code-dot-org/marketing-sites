# `componentLibrary/snackbar`

## Consuming This Component

This package doesn't export any component, as we use @mui/material's
[Snackbar](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-snackbar/) component for this functionality. You can find stories in this
folder illustrating how to it using our design system's theme though.

For guidelines on how to use these components and the features they
offer, [visit Storybook](https://code-dot-org.github.io/code-dot-org/component-library-storybook/_)
(link to be updated once code-dot-org storybook will be public.).
Or run storybook locally and go
to [Design System / Slider](http://localhost:9001/?path=/story/designsystem-slider--default-slider).
