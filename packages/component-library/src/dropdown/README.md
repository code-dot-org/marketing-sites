# `componentLibrary/dropdown - CustomDropdown`

### Status: `Ready for Dev`

## Consuming This Component

This package exports one styled React component: [CustomDropdown](CustomDropdown.tsx). You can import it like this:

```javascript
import {CustomDropdown} from '@code-dot-org/component-library/dropdown';
```

CustomDropdown is a dropdown with a completely customizeable dropdown container that is shown when the button is pressed. You should only use `CustomDropdown` if all other DSCO dropdowns do not have the functionality you are looking for.

For guidelines on how to use these components and the features they
offer, [visit Storybook](https://code-dot-org.github.io/dsco_)
(link to be updated once code-dot-org storybook will be public.).
Or run storybook locally and go
to [Design System / Action Dropdown](http://localhost:9001/?path=/story/designsystem-dropdown-icon-dropdown--default-icon-dropdown).
