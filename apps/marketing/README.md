# Code.org Marketing Application

## Getting Started

### Secrets

Contentful API Keys and other secrets will need to be populated for this application to run correctly.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. For each entry in `.env`, see the instructions for how to obtain an API Key.

**Note**: `.env` must not be committed to source. It is git ignored by default.

### Developing
First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
